# Art Book NextUI Theme

## Acknowledgments

- This theme is based on Art Book Next for ES-DE by Anthony Caccese and can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/anthonycaccese/art-book-next-es-de).
- Most system logos were sourced and modified from the excellent work done by Dan Patrick here. I modified each to be compatible with EmulationStation's current SVG support.
- ChangaOne font is by Eduardo Tunni
- Oxygen font is by Vernon Adams
- Auto-Collection Genre background art created by @nautipuss
- Metadata Icons sourced from FontAwesome
- The Noir System Artwork set was created and provided by tenlevels with help from f8less and inspired by the artwork from the Epic Noir theme by chicuelo
- The Outline System Artwork set was created and provided by Joppa Fallston, inspired by denizonm's work.
- Some System Artwork was created and provided by theUnBurn
- Thank you to GenoCL for the idea of the multi-artwork system view. It got me to think about ES themes in a different way when building it out and it came out awesome.
