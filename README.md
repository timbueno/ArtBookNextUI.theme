## Process
1. Gather all required assets from the [Art Book Next ES-DE GitHub](https://github.com/anthonycaccese/art-book-next-es-de).
2. Create clear system icon.
3. Create a system background.
4. Create a system list background.
5. Create new system group. Give group a recognizable name containing the NextUI tag in parenthesis. If multiple tags are required use a forward slash and NOT a back slash.
6. System Background Tips
    - Logo width: No wider than 291 pixels. 
    - Use the "Logo Frame" as a guide to center the logo.
    - Add a drop shadow effect to the logo: X: 0, Y: 0, Spread: 16, Color: Black 50%
7. System List Background Tips
    - Logo width: No wider than 200 pixels.
    - Use the "Logo Frame" as a guide to center the logo.
8. Use other system frames as a guide for how to name the new system.
9. Set up exporting at 1x PNG for each frame.
10. With nothing in the board selected: File -> Export. All files should be automatically exported to the correct directory structure.
